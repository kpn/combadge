# Service protocol

In Combadge a definition of a service _protocol_ (also known as _interface_) is de-coupled from a service _implementation_. That allows a developer to define a service's interface and later bind it to a [_backend_][backends] which in turn is directly responsible for handling requests and responses.

To define a service protocol one makes use of the [PEP 544](https://peps.python.org/pep-0544/) aka «structural subtyping». Combadge inspects the protocol during «binding».
