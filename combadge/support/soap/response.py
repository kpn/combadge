    Note: This class is intended for use with the SOAP Fault specification
        For custom errors returned in a SOAP response body (such as `<error>` tag),
        subclass the `ErrorResponse`.

    Tip:
        SOAP backends should **always** fall back to `BaseSoapFault` if the actual SOAP fault
        does not match any of the protocol's return types.

        For client developers, this means that it is a good idea to include `BaseSoapFault`
        as the last possible `Union` variant to let users know that is should be handled.
