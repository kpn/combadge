        Warning: Mypy does not recognize `NoReturn` here
            As of the time of writing, Mypy does not infer response type correctly
            after calling `response.raise_for_result()`.
            The `NoReturn` should suggest that `response` can only be a successful response
            (otherwise, the next line would be unreachable).

            The advice is to use [`unwrap()`][combadge.core.response.BaseResponse.unwrap]

        Return itself if the call was successful, raises an exception otherwise.

        This method allows «unpacking» a response with proper type hinting.
        The trick here is that all error responses' `unwrap()` are annotated with `NoReturn`,
        which suggests a type linter, that `unwrap()` may never return an error.

        Examples:
            >>> class MyResponse(SuccessfulResponse): ...
            >>>
            >>> class MyErrorResponse(ErrorResponse): ...
            >>>

            >>> assert_type(service.call(), Union[MyResponse, MyErrorResponse])

        Raises:
            ErrorResponse.Error: an error derived from `ErrorResponse`

        Dynamically derived exception class.

        For each model inherited from `ErrorResponse` Combadge generates an exception
        class, which is accessible through the `<ModelClass>.Error` attribute.

        Examples:
            >>> class InvalidInput(ErrorResponse):
            >>>     code: Literal["INVALID_INPUT"]

        Note: Why dynamically constructed class?
            The problem with `pydantic` is that you can't inherit from `BaseModel` and `Exception`
            at the same time. Thus, Combadge dynamically constructs a derived exception class,
            which is available via the class attribute and raised by `raise_for_result()` and `unwrap()`.
